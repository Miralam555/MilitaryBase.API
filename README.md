# FinalProject
AOP-Based Architecture
This project is my final submission for the course and is built using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) principles. The architecture is designed with a clean separation of concerns, enabling better modularity and maintainability.

Key cross-cutting concerns implemented in this project include:

Logging

Validation

Global Exception Handling

Performance Monitoring

These concerns are handled via aspects, making the system flexible and scalable. The architecture follows a plug-and-play (attach-and-detach) approach, allowing each module to be added or removed without impacting the core business logic.

This design ensures that business components remain focused on their primary responsibilities, while secondary operations are managed separately through reusable and declarative aspects.
