# Military Personnel Management API

**Military Personnel Management API** is a modular and scalable Web API built using **ASP.NET Core 8**. The project is designed around **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** principles to promote clean separation of concerns and maintainable code.

This system is intended for managing military personnel data, such as registration, tracking, and operational handling. The architecture allows business logic to remain focused and clean, while cross-cutting concerns are handled through reusable and declarative aspects.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **AOP-based architecture**
- **Modular plug-and-play components**
- **Clean, maintainable, and testable codebase**
- **RESTful API design**
- **Swagger/OpenAPI documentation**

## 🧠 Cross-Cutting Concerns (Handled via AOP)

This project leverages custom AOP-based aspects to handle:

- 🧠 **Caching** — improving performance through response/data caching  
- 📝 **Logging** — structured logging for better traceability  
- ✅ **Validation** — declarative request validation  
- 💥 **Global Exception Handling** — centralized error management  
- ⏱️ **Performance Monitoring** — tracking execution time of operations  

These concerns are managed independently of core business logic, making the system clean and flexible.
